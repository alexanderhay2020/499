Weeks 1-2: Determine which actuators to use, order actuators
Find EMG sensor, either on hand or order If on hand, begin building dataset Begin design of apparatus based on dimensions of actuators ordered
Weeks 3-4: Assembly, redesign if necessary (probably necessary)
Begin/continue EMG dataset Write crude controller
Weeks 5-6: Finish assembly Finish controller Start NN controller
Weeks 7-8: Continue NN development
Weeks 9-10: Overflow
